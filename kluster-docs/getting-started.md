# Getting started guide

Welcome to the Kluster.ai getting started guide! This guide provides a quick introduction to submitting Batch jobs.

Kluster.ai is API-compatible with the OpenAI library, supporting `model`, `messages`, and `stream` functions. If additional request properties are needed, they can be requested during the Early Access Plan. To install the OpenAI Python library, follow the [instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/python-library){target=\_blank} on OpenAI's documentation.

OpenAI object definitions are included to help you get started. For more details, refer to the OpenAI [API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction){target=\_blank}. The following sections offer Curl and Python examples on locating the API key, defining Batch jobs as a JSON Lines file, uploading the file to the Kluster.ai endpoint, invoking the chat completion endpoint, monitoring job progress, retrieving results, listing Batch objects, and canceling requests.

## Get Your API Key

Navigate to the [platform.kluster.ai](http://platform.kluster.ai){target=\_blank} web app and select **API Keys** from the left-hand menu. Create a new API key by specifying the API key name. You'll need this to set the auth header in all of the API requests.

## List Supported Models

First, you can use the models endpoint to list out the supported models that. Currently, only Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct are supported. The response is a list of model objects.

<div class="grid" markdown>
<div markdown>

**Request**

`get https://api.kluster.ai/v1/models`

Lists the currently available models.

**Returns**

`id` ++"string"++

The model identifier, which can be referenced in the API endpoints.

---

`created` ++"integer"++

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the model was created.

---

`object` ++"string"++

The object type, which is always `model`.

---

`owned_by` ++"string"++

The organization that owns the model.

</div>
<div markdown>

```bash title="Example request"
curl https://api.kluster.ai/v1/models \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" 
```

```json title="Response"

   }
]
```

## Create a Batch File with a Collection of Jobs

Create a [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) file containing a collection of `batch request input` objects. The body of each request is a `chat completion` object with the endpoint `/v1/chat/completions`. Each request must include a unique `custom_id` used to reference results after the Batch job has been completed.

<div class="grid" markdown>
<div markdown>

**Batch request input object**

`custom_id` ++"string"++

A developer-provided per-request ID that will be used to match outputs to inputs. Must be unique for each request in a Batch.

---

`method` ++"string"++

The HTTP method to be used for the request. Currently, only `POST` is supported.

---

`url` ++"string"++

The `/v1/chat/completions` API relative URL.

---

**Request body**

`body` ++"object"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

The request body object (chat completion object).

??? child "Show properties"

    `model` ++"string"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    ID of the model to use. See the model endpoint compatibility table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

    ---

    `messages` ++"array"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

    A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.

    ??? child "Show properties"

        `role` ++"string"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span>

        The role of the messages author, in this case `assistant`.

        ---

        `content` ++"string or array"++

        The contents of the assistant message.  

        ---

        `refusal` ++"string or null"++

        The refusal message by the assistant.
        
        ---

        `name` ++"string"++

        An optional name for the participant. Provides the model information to differentiate between participants of the same role.

    ---

    `store` ++"boolean or null"++

    Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in our model distillation or evals products. Defaults to `false`.

    ---

    `metadata` ++"object or null"++

    Developer-defined tags and values used for filtering completions in the dashboard.

    ---

    `frequency_penalty` ++"number or null"++

    Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood of repeating the same line verbatim. Defaults to `0`.

    ---

    `logit_bias` ++"map"++

    Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Defaults to `null`.

    Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase the likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

    ---

    `logprobs` ++"boolean or null"++

    Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`. Defaults to `false`.

    ---

    `top_logprobs` ++"integer or null"++

    An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

    ---

    `max_tokens` ++"integer or null"++ *deprecated*

    This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`.

    The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control costs for text generated via API.

    ---

    `max_completion_tokens` ++"integer or null"++

    An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

    ---

    `n` ++"integer or null"++

    The number of chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs. Defaults to `1`.

    ---

    `presence_penalty` ++"number or null"++

    Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. Defaults to `0`.

    ---

    `response_format` ++"object"++

    An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct.

    Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema.

    Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

    **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

    ---

    `seed` ++"integer or null"++

    This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

    ---

    `service_tier` ++"string or null"++

    Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. Defaults to `null`. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

    - If set to `auto`, and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted
    - If set to `auto`, and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee
    - If set to `default`, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarantee
    - When not set, the default behavior is `auto`
    - When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` utilized

    ---

    `stop` ++"string or array or null"++

    Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. Defaults to `null`.

    ---

    `stream` ++"boolean or null"++

    If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPTpl. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. Defaults to `false`.

    ---

    `stream_options` ++"object or null"++

    Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`. Defaults to `null`

    ---

    `temperature` ++"number or null"++

    The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. Defaults to `1`.

    It is generally recommended to alter this or `top_p` but not both.

    ---

    `top_p` ++"number or null"++

    An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. Defaults to `1`.

    It is generally recommended to alter this or `temperature` but not both.

    ---

    `tools` ++"array"++

    A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

    ---

    `tool_choice` ++"string or object"++

    Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.

    - `none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message
    - `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools
    - `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool

    `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.

    ---

    `parallel_tool_calls` ++"boolean"++

    Whether to enable [**parallel function calling**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/parallel-function-calling){target=\_blank} during tool use. Defaults to `true`.

    ---

    `user` ++"string"++

    A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.

    ---

    `function_call` ++"string or object"++ *deprecated*

    This value is now deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

    Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

    - `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message
    - `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function

    `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.

    ---

    `functions` ++"array"++ *deprecated*

    This value is now deprecated in favor of `tools`.

    A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

**Returns**

A chat completion object, or a streamed sequence of chat completion chunk objects if the request is streamed.

`id` ++"string"++

A unique identifier for the chat completion.

---

`choices` ++"array"++

A list of chat completion choices. Can be more than one if `n` is greater than `1`.

??? child "Show properties"

    `finish_reason` ++"string"++
    
    The reason the model stopped generating tokens. This will be `stop` if the model hit a natural stop point or a provided stop sequence, `length` if the maximum number of tokens specified in the request was reached, `content_filter` if content was omitted due to a flag from our content filters, `tool_calls` if the model called a tool, or `function_call` (deprecated) if the model called a function.

    ---
